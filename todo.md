Suggestions for Ergonomic Improvement:

Information Architecture (IA) & Navigation:

Plan Your Structure: As you add content, think carefully about how users will look for information. Group related topics logically using nested folders within content/en/docs/. A shallow structure is okay for a few pages, but a deeper, well-organized hierarchy is crucial for larger sites. Aim for 2-3 levels deep in most cases.

Utilize _index.md Files: Every folder within content/docs/ that represents a section (not just a single page) should have an _index.md file. This file serves as the landing page for that section. Use it to:

Briefly explain what the section covers.

Provide links to the most important pages within that section (acting like a mini table of contents). This helps users orient themselves without having to scan the entire sidebar.

Example: Create content/en/docs/Getting started/_index.md to introduce the getting started process.

Review Sidebar Titles: Ensure folder and file names (which often translate to sidebar titles) are clear, concise, and accurately reflect the content. Use Hugo's title front matter field to override if the filename isn't ideal for display.

Top Navigation: Review the main navigation links ([[menu.main]] in hugo.yaml). Are they the most critical entry points for your users? Keep this concise.

Content Readability & Scannability:

Break Up Text: Use short paragraphs, headings (##, ###, etc.), bullet points, and numbered lists to make content easier to scan and digest.

Meaningful Headings: Headings structure the page and help users quickly find relevant parts. Make them descriptive.

Use Visuals Appropriately: Continue using videos and add screenshots or diagrams where they can clarify complex points better than text alone.

Code Blocks: Use clear syntax highlighting (specify the language, e.g., yaml ...) and keep code snippets focused on the point being made. Docsy handles this well, just ensure you use it effectively.

Emphasis: Use bold for emphasis and code formatting for filenames, commands, or variables, but don't overuse them.

Search Functionality:

Ensure it Works: Your hugo.yaml has offlineSearch: true. Test the search thoroughly. Does it find content within pages? Are the results relevant?

Consider Algolia (Later): If the site grows very large and offline search becomes slow or less effective, consider implementing Algolia DocSearch (free for open-source projects) for a more powerful search experience.

User Orientation & Context:

Breadcrumbs: Docsy usually includes breadcrumbs. Ensure they are visible and accurate, as they help users understand where they are in the site structure.

Page Table of Contents: Docsy can automatically generate a "On this page" section based on headings. This is excellent for longer pages. Ensure your headings are structured correctly for this to work well. Check the Docsy theme configuration if it's not showing up.

Next/Previous Links: These are useful for guiding users through a sequence (like a tutorial). Ensure they appear where appropriate (Docsy usually adds them automatically based on file order or front matter weighting).

Accessibility (A11y):

Alt Text: Add descriptive alt text to all images. This is crucial for screen readers and also displays if an image fails to load.

Semantic HTML: Stick to standard Markdown and let Docsy/Hugo generate semantic HTML (using headings correctly, lists for lists, etc.). Avoid using formatting purely for visual effect if a semantic element exists.

Color Contrast: If you customize the site's colors later, ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability (use online contrast checkers).

Performance:

Image Optimization: Resize images to appropriate dimensions before uploading. Use formats like WebP (with fallbacks) or optimized JPEGs/PNGs.

Video Optimization: You've already tackled video encoding, which is great! Ensure files are reasonably compressed.

Example Action Steps:

Create content/en/docs/Getting started/_index.md. Add a brief overview of the setup process and maybe link directly to site_settings.md and social_media.md.

Go through site settings.md and social media.md. Add more descriptive headings (e.g., ## Adding Your Logo, ## Configuring Social Links). Break up any long text blocks.

Add a placeholder poster image for your video in site settings.md.

Test the search bar on the deployed site.
